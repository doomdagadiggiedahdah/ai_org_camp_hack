## so what do I need to do?
## (done for now) Get rules if they don't already exist.
    ## maybe have a json file that stores the settings
    ## if none, takes the regulations and creates a list of rules
    ## if exists, prompts, "want to see / edit rules or run?"
    ## done.
## run rules on the docs
    ## import docs into var
    ## send doc as context to morphism call
        ## specify output, just have it be a pandas df? that feels sleek.
    ## print out results that would be input on the form. Seems simple.


## ok so now I need to generate the rules. It just needs to be a prompt that's fed. 
    ## let's edit the prompt a lil bit.
    ## still needs some work but this will be fine for a bit.

## run the rules on the doc.
    ## import the new doc
    ## get info from it
    ## ask GPT to look through the doc using the rules generated and output in a csv the info of the form submission.
    ## print out the submission info for a human to look over.
        ## next would include the CI of whether or not it's reliable data.


# TODO
    ## I don't like the initial user interaction, maybe it's fine for demoing though.
    ## where am I at. running rules on the doc. which part of that?
        ## we have the rules, next have a single file be importable
        ## we've got program flow, but no items are being flagged right now, and that's an issue.
            ## let's make sure that
